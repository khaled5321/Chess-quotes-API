268,Emanuel Lasker,First-class players lose to second-class players because second-class players sometimes play a first-class game.
269,Siegbert Tarrasch,"Bobby is the finest chess player this country ever produced. His memory for the moves, his brilliance in dreaming up combinations, and his fierce determination to win are uncanny."
270,John Collins,"After a bad opening, there is hope for the middle game. After a bad middle game, there is hope for the endgame. But once you are in the endgame, the moment of truth has arrived."
271,Edmar Mednis,Weak points or holes in the opponent’s position must be occupied by pieces not pawns.
272,Siegbert Tarrasch,There is only one thing Fischer does in chess without pleasure: to lose!
273,Boris Spassky,Bobby Fischer is the greatest chess player who has ever lived.
274,Ken Smith,Up to this point white has been following well-known analysis. But now he makes a fatal error: he begins to use his own head.
275,Siegbert Tarrasch,Fischer was a master of clarity and a king of artful positioning. His opponents would see where he was going but were powerless to stop him.
276,Bruce Pandolfini,"No other master has such a terrific will to win. At the board he radiates danger, and even the strongest opponents tend to freeze, like rabbits when they smell a panther. Even his weaknesses are dangerous."
277,Anonymous German Expert,White lost because he failed to remember the right continuation and had to think up the moves himself.
278,Siegbert Tarrasch,"Not only will I predict his triumph over Botvinnik, but I’ll go further and say that he’ll probably be the greatest chess player that ever lived."
279,John Collins,I consider Fischer to be one of the greatest opening experts ever.
280,Keith Hayward,I like to say that Bobby Fischer was the greatest player ever. But what made Fischer a genius was his ability to blend an American freshness and pragmatism with Russian ideas about strategy.
281,Bruce Pandolfini,At this time Fischer is simply a level above all the best chess players in the world.
282,John Jacobs,I have always a slight feeling of pity for the man who has no knowledge of chess.
283,Siegbert Tarrasch,There’s never before been a chess player with such a thorough knowledge of the intricacies of the game and such an absolutely indomitable will to win. I think Bobby is the greatest player that ever lived.
284,Lisa Lane,He who takes the queen’s Knight’s pawn will sleep in the streets.
285,Anonymous,"I had a toothache during the first game. In the second game I had a headache. In the third game it was an attack of rheumatism. In the fourth game, I wasn’t feeling well. And in the fifth game? Well, must one have to win every game?"
286,Siegbert Tarrasch,The stomach is an essential part of the chess master.
287,Bent Larsen,"I’m not a materialistic person, in that, I don’t suffer the lack or loss of money.  The absence of worldly goods I don’t look back on. For chess is a way I can be as materialistic as I want without having to sell my soul"
288,Jamie Walter Adams,"These are not pieces, they are men! For any man to walk into the line of fire will be one less man in your army to fight for you. Value every troop and use him wisely, throw him not to the dogs as he is there to serve his king."
289,Jamie Walter Adams,"Chess isn’t a game of speed, it is a game of speech through actions."
290,Matthew Selman,Life like chess is about knowing to do the right move at the right time.
291,Kaleb Rivera,Come on Harry!
292,Simon Williams,"Some people think that if their opponent plays a beautiful game, it’s okay to lose. I don’t. You have to be merciless."
293,Magnus Carlsen,It's one of those types of positions where he has pieces on squares.
294,John ~ZugAddict~ Chernoff,"On the bright side, I no longer have any more pieces to lose."
295,John ~ZugAddict~ Chernoff,Tactics... Tactics are your friends. But they are weird friends who do strange things.
296,John ~ZugAddict~ Chernoff,You can't take the pawn because then the other will queen. Like wonder twin powers
297,John ~ZugAddict~ Chernoff,"Most of the gods throw dice but Fate plays chess, and you don't find out until too late that he's been using two queens all along."
298,Terry Pratchett,"Atomic is just like regular chess, except you're exploding, everything's exploding, and you're in bullet hell."
299,Unihedron 0,"lichess is better, but it's free."
300,Thibault Duplessis,"When you trade, the key concern is not always the value of the pieces being exchanged, but what’s left on the board."
301,Dan Heisman,I detest the endgame. A well-played game should be practically decided in the middlegame.
302,David Janowski,"Many men, many styles; what is chess style but the intangible expression of the will to win."
303,Aron Nimzowitsch,"Never play for the win, never play for the draw, just play chess!"
304,Alexander Khalifman,"In chess, knowledge is a very transient thing. It changes so fast that even a single mouse-slip sometimes changes the evaluation."
305,Viswanathan Anand,Having good strategies in playing chess is often a good indication of being focused in life.
306,Martin Dansky,"Chess is an infinitely complex game, which one can play in infinitely numerous and varied ways."
307,Vladimir Kramnik,"Chess: It’s like alcohol. It’s a drug. I have to control it, or it could overwhelm me."
308,Charles Krauthammer,Drawing general conclusions about your main weaknesses can provide a great stimulus to further growth.
309,Alexander Kotov,The good thing in chess is that very often the best moves are the most beautiful ones. The beauty of logic.
310,Boris Gelfand,Any experienced player knows how a change in the character of the play influences your psychological mood.
311,Garry Kasparov,Be a harsh critic of your own wins.
312,Vasilios Kotronias,"Good players develop a tactical instinct, a sense of what is possible or likely and what is not worth calculating."
313,Sam Reshevsky,"Lack of patience is probably the most common reason for losing a game, or drawing games that should have been won."
314,Bent Larsen,"The scheme of a game is played on positional lines; the decision of it, as a rule, is effected by combinations."
315,Richard Reti,On the chessboard lies and hypocrisy do not last long.
316,Emanuel Lasker,The single most important thing in life is to believe in yourself regardless of what everyone else says.
317,Hikaru Nakamura,"Attackers may sometimes regret bad moves, but it is much worse to forever regret an opportunity you allowed to pass you by."
318,Garry Kasparov,My favorite victory is when it is not even clear where my opponent made a mistake.
319,Peter Leko,"Win with grace, lose with dignity."
320,Susan Polgar,"Pawns are such fascinating pieces, too...So small, almost insignificant, and yet--they can depose kings."
321,Lavie Tidhar,"The move is there, but you must see it."
322,Savielly Tartakower,"The kings are an apt metaphor for human beings: utterly constrained by the rules of the game, defenseless against bombardment from all sides, able only to temporarily dodge disaster by moving one step in any direction."
323,Jennifer duBois,"If chess is an art, Alekhine. If chess is a science, Capablanca. If chess is a struggle, Lasker. --on who he thought was the best player."
324,Savielly Tartakower,"Chess is a good mistress, but a bad master."
325,Gerald Abrahams,I often play a move I know how to refute.
326,Bent Larsen,"First restrain, next blockade, lastly destroy."
327,Aron Nimzowitsch,"If you don't know what to do, find your worst piece and look for a better square."
328,Gerard Schwarz,Players who balk at playing one-minute chess are failing to see the whole picture. They shouldn’t be worrying that they will make more mistakes – they should be rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of all the mistakes their opponents will make.
329,Hikaru Nakamura,"A Chess game is divided into three stages: the first, when you hope you have the advantage, the second when you believe that you have an advantage, and the third ... when you know you're going to lose !"
330,Savielly Tartakower,"A Queen's sacrifice, even when fairly obvious, always rejoices the heart of the chess-lover."
331,Savielly Tartakower,"A chess game, after all, is a fight in which all possible factors must be made use of, and in which a knowledge of the opponent's good and bad qualities is of the greatest importance."
332,Emanuel Lasker,A chess player never has a heart attack in a good position.
333,Bent Larsen,"A computer beat me in chess, but it was no match when it came to kickboxing."
334,Emo Phillips,A considerable role in the forming of my style was played by an early attraction to study composition.
335,Vasily Smyslov,A defeatist spirit must inevitably lead to disaster.
336,Eugene Znosko-Borovsky,"A draw can be obtained not only by repeating moves, but also by one weak move."
337,Savielly Tartakower,"A draw may be the beautiful and logical result of fine attacks and parries; and the public ought to appreciate such games, in contrast, of course, to the fear-and-laziness draws."
338,Bent Larsen,A gambit never becomes sheer routine as long as you fear you may lose the king and pawn ending!
339,Bent Larsen,A great chess player always has a very good memory.
340,Leonid Shamkovich,A knight ending is really a pawn ending.
341,Mikhail Botvinnik,"A male scorpion is stabbed to death after mating. In chess, the powerful queen often does the same to the king without giving him the satisfaction of a lover."
342,Gregor Piatigorsky,"A pawn, when separated from his fellows, will seldom or never make a fortune."
343,Francois-Andre Danican Philidor,"A plan is made for a few moves only, not for the whole game."
344,Rueben Fine,"A player can sometimes afford the luxury of an inaccurate move, or even a definite error, in the opening or middlegame without necessarily obtaining a lost position. In the endgame ... an error can be decisive, and we are rarely presented with a second chance."
345,Paul Keres,"A real sacrifice involves a radical change in the character of a game which cannot be effected without foresight, fantasy, and the willingness to risk."
346,Leonid Shamkovich,"A sport, a struggle for results and a fight for prizes. I think that the discussion about \chess is science or chess is art\ is already inappropriate. The purpose of modern chess is to reach a result."
347,Alexander Morozevich,"A strong player requires only a few minutes of thought to get to the heart of the conflict. You see a solution immediately, and half an hour later merely convince yourself that your intuition has not deceived you."
348,David Bronstein,"A win gives one a feeling of self-affirmation, and success - a feeling of self-expression, but only a sensible harmonization between these urges can bring really great achievements in chess."
349,Oleg Romanishin,"Above all else, before playing in competitions a player must have regard to his health, for if he is suffering from ill-health he cannot hope for success. In this connection the best of all tonics is 15 to 20 days in the fresh air, in the country."
350,Mikhail Botvinnik,"According to such great attacking players as Bronstein and Tal, most combinations are inspired by the player's memories of earlier games."
351,Pal Benko,"After I won the title, I was confronted with the real world. People do not behave naturally anymore – hypocrisy is everywhere."
352,Boris Spassky,"After a great deal of discussion in Soviet literature about the correct definition of a combination, it was decided that from the point of view of a methodical approach it was best to settle on this definition - A combination is a forced variation with a sacrifice."
353,Alexander Kotov,"Agreeing to draws in the middlegame, equal or otherwise, deprives you of the opportunity to practice playing endgames, and the endgame is probably where you need the most practice."
354,Pal Benko,"All chess masters have on occasion played a magnificent game and then lost it by a stupid mistake, perhaps in time pressure and it may perhaps seem unjust that all their beautiful ideas get no other recognition than a zero on the tournament table."
355,Bent Larsen,"All chess players know what a combination is. Whether one makes it oneself, or is its victim, or reads of it, it stands out from the rest of the game and stirs one's admiration."
356,Eugene Znosko-Borowski,All conceptions in the game of chess have a geometrical basis.
357,Eugene Znosko-Borowski,All lines of play which lead to the imprisonment of the bishop are on principle to be condemned. (on the closed Ruy Lopez)
358,Siegbert Tarrasch,All that matters on the chessboard is good moves.
359,Bobby Fischer,All that now seems to stand between Nigel and the prospect of the world crown is the unfortunate fact that fate brought him into this world only two years after Kasparov.
360,(prophetic comment in 1987) - Garry Kasparov,Along with my retirement from chess analytical work seems to have gone too.
361,Mikhail Botvinnik,"Although the Knight is generally considered to be on a par with the Bishop in strength, the latter piece is somewhat stronger in the majority of cases in which they are opposed to each other."
362,Jose Capablanca,"Amberley excelled at chess - a mark, Watson, of a scheming mind."
363,Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,"Americans really don't know much about chess. But I think when I beat Spassky, that Americans will take a greater interest in chess. Americans like winners."
364,Bobby Fischer,"Among top grandmasters the Dutch is a rare defense, which is good reason to play it! It has not been studied very deeply by many opponents, and theory, based on a small number of 'reliable' games, must be rather unreliable."
365,Bent Larsen,"An amusing fact: as far as I can recall, when playing the Ruy Lopez I have not yet once in my life had to face the Marshall Attack!"
366,Anatoly Karpov,"An innovation need not be especially ingenious, but it must be well worked out."
367,Paul Keres,An isolated pawn spreads gloom all over the chessboard.
368,Savielly Tartakower,"Analysis is a glittering opportunity for training: it is just here that capacity for work, perseverance and stamina are cultivated, and these qualities are, in truth, as necessary to a chess player as a marathon runner."
369,Lev Polugaevsky,"Analysis, if it is really carried out with a complete concentration of his powers, forms and completes a chess player."
370,Lev Polugaevsky,Anyone who wishes to learn how to play chess well must make himself or herself thoroughly conversant with the play in positions where the players have castled on opposite sides.
371,Alexander Kotov,"Apart from direct mistakes, there is nothing more ruinous than routine play, the aim of which is mechanical development."
372,Alexei Suetin,"As Rousseau could not compose without his cat beside him, so I cannot play chess without my king's bishop. In its absence the game to me is lifeless and void. The vitalizing factor is missing, and I can devise no plan of attack."
373,Siegbert Tarrasch,"As a chess player one has to be able to control one’s feelings, one has to be as cold as a machine."
374,Levon Aronian,"As a rule, pawn endings have a forced character, and they can be worked out conclusively."
375,Mark Dvoretsky,"As a rule, so-called \positional\ sacrifices are considered more difficult, and therefore more praise-worthy than those which are based exclusively on an exact calculation of tactical possibilities."
376,Alexander Alekhine,"As a rule, the more mistakes there are in a game, the more memorable it remains, because you have suffered and worried over each mistake at the board."
377,Victor Korchnoi,"As long as my opponent has not yet castled, on each move I seek a pretext for an offensive. Even when I realize that the king is not in danger."
378,Mikhail Tal,"As often as not, his strategy consists of stifling Black's activity and then winning in an endgame thanks to his superior pawn structure."
379,Neil McDonald (1998),Attack! Always Attack!
380,Adolf Anderssen,"Attackers may sometimes regret bad moves, but it is much worse to forever regret an opportunity you allowed to pass you by."
381,Garry Kasparov,"Avoidance of mistakes is the beginning, as it is the end, of mastery in chess."
382,Eugene Znosko-Borovsky,"Barcza is the most versatile player in the opening. He sometimes plays P-KKt3 on the first, sometimes on the second, sometimes on the third, and sometimes only on the fourth move."
383,reputedly stated by Harry Golombek,Before Geller we did not understand the King's Indian Defence.
384,Mikhail Botvinnik,"Begone! Ignorant and impudent knight, not even in chess can a King be taken."
385,King Louis VI (reputedly stated to one of his knights in 1110 after he was nearly captured by enemy forces),Black's d5-square is too weak.
386,Ulf Andersson  (on the Dragon variation),Blitz chess kills your ideas.
387,Bobby Fischer,Bobby Fischer started off each game with a great advantage: after the opening he had used less time than his opponent and thus had more time available later on. The major reason why he never had serious time pressure was that his rapid opening play simply left sufficient time for the middlegame.
388,Edmar Mednis,Books on the openings abound; nor are works on the end game wanting; but those on the middle game can be counted on the fingers of one hand.
389,Harry Golombek,"Boris Vasilievich was the only top-class player of his generation who played gambits regularly and without fear ... Over a period of 30 years he did not lose a single game with the King's Gambit, and among those defeated were numerous strong players of all generations, from Averbakh, Bronstein and Fischer, to Seirawan."
390,Garry Kasparov,"Botvinnik tried to take the mystery out of Chess, always relating it to situations in ordinary life. He used to call chess a typical inexact problem similar to those which people are always having to solve in everyday life."
391,Garry Kasparov,"But alas! Like many another consummation devoutly to be wished, the actual performance was a disappointing one. (on the long awaited Lasker-Capablanca match in 1921)"
392,Fred Reinfeld,"But how difficult it can be to gain the desired full point against an opponent of inferior strength, when this is demanded by the tournament position!"
393,Anatoly Karpov,"But whatever you might say and whatever I might say, a machine which can play chess with people is one of the most marvellous wonders of our 20th century!"
394,David Bronstein,"But you see when I play a game of Bobby, there is no style. Bobby played perfectly. And perfection has no style."
395,Miguel Najdorf,"By all means examine the games of the great chess players, but don't swallow them whole. Their games are valuable not for their separate moves, but for their vision of chess, their way of thinking."
396,Anatoly Karpov,"By positional play a master tries to prove and exploit true values, whereas by combinations he seeks to refute false values ... A combination produces an unexpected re-assessment of values."
397,Emanuel Lasker,By some ardent enthusiasts Chess has been elevated into a science or an art. It is neither; but its principal characteristic seems to be what human nature mostly delights in a fight.
398,Emanuel Lasker,"By strictly observing Botvinnik's rule regarding the thorough analysis of one's own games, with the years I have come to realize that this provides the foundation for the continuous development of chess mastery."
399,Garry Kasparov,"By the mid-1990s the number of people with some experience of using computers was many orders of magnitude greater than in the 1960s. In the Kasparov defeat they recognized that here was a great triumph for programmers, but not one that may compete with the human intelligence that helps us to lead our lives."
400,Igor Aleksander,"By the time a player becomes a Grandmaster, almost all of his training time is dedicated to work on this first phase. The opening is the only phase that holds out the potential for true creativity and doing something entirely new."
401,Garry Kasparov,"By what right does White, in an absolutely even position, such as after move one, when both sides have advanced 1. e4, sacrifice a pawn, whose recapture is quite uncertain, and open up his kingside to attack? And then follow up this policy by leaving the check of the black queen open? None whatever !"
402,Emanuel Lasker,Can you imagine the relief it gives a mother when her child amuses herself quietly for hours on end?

408,"Chess continues to advance over time, so the players of the future will inevitably surpass me in the quality of their play, assuming the rules and regulations allow them to play serious chess.
